# TypeScript + React + Webpack

Just some boilerplate so that I don't have to re-invent the wheel every time I want to start a new project with the tooling I usually end up using (currently React, TypeScript, SCSS, Webpack). Definitely a work in progress, subject to change as I learn more / my preferences evolve.

## Current Features

* React 16
* Webpack 4
* TypeScript 3
* Dev and Prod Webpack configs
* Support for .env files
* Support for scss files
